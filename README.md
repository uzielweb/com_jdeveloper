## JDEVELOPER Joomla Component



Philosophy:

Every user of Joomla shall create own Joomla! Extensions by a minimum of knowledge about programming and by a minimum of time. 
What you can do with JDeveloper:

    Create Components
    Create modules
    Create templates
    Create plugins
    Create packages

    Create JFormField classes
    Create JFormRule classes
    ZIP existing (installed) components, modules, plugins, templates
    Import tables from database

 
What makes JDeveloper special:

    It is totally free and easy to use
    You can create unlimited components and tables
    You can use all Joomla core functions
    You have many possibilities to configurate your component

Why JDeveloper is totally free:

As I began programming Joomla! extensions I recognized how well this CMS is programmed. Open CMS systems follow the philosophy that everyone should be able to present information on the web by a minimum of work. But there is one big handicap: You can only use existing extensions if you`re not a programmer. So I thought, I could help the Joomla! community if I create an extension which is able to create extensions itself. I personally am a big fan of open source programming and of Joomla!, so I combined these to passions and created a free Joomla! extension creator.
